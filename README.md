# Animal Shelter CRUD Operations

**Project Overview**

This repo provides a Python module for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database (update and Delete is work in progress). The module is designed to be reusable and can be imported into other Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks. It includes a class, AnimalShelter, that provides methods to interact with a MongoDB collection.

**Example**

**Setup Instructions**

Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. MongoDB server
3. pymongo library

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
	```git clone git@github.com:Joseph-Les/CRUDInPython.git```
2. Install the required Python packages:
	```pip install pymongo```
3. Ensure your MongoDB server is running.


**Usage - Initialization**

The AnimalShelter class is used to interact with the MongoDB collection. You need to initialize it with your MongoDB connection details.

	shelter = AnimalShelter(user='', password='', host='', port=, db='', collection='')

**Create Method**

The create method inserts a document into the collection.
	
	new_animal = {
    		"name": "Max",
    		"species": "Dog",
    		"breed": "Golden Retriever",
    		"age": 5,
    		"adopted": False
	}
	insert_success = shelter.create(new_animal)
	print(f"Insert success: {insert_success}")

**Read Method**

The read method queries for documents in the collection based on a given query.

	query = {"species": "Dog"}
	dogs = shelter.read(query)
	print(f"Found dogs: {dogs}")

**Testing**

1. Ensure you your mongo database server is running. Gather the DB name and the user to be used.
	1A. If you would like, create a new user to interact with the database:

    	db.createUser ({ user: "<name of the user>", pwd: "<password>", roles [( role: "readWrite", db: "<name of database>" }] })
   
3. After successfully gathering your DB and User information, start a new Jupyter Notebook.
4. Insert the python program into the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook. Replace user, passwprd, host, port, db, collection, with your own user information.
5. If using a different database, please edit the Create and Read method to match your collection.
6. Execute the code in Jupyter Notebook.

# Animal Shelter CRUD Operations

**Project Overview**

This project provides a Python module for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database. (Update and Delete is work in progress) The module is designed to be reusable and can be imported into other Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks. It includes a class, AnimalShelter, that provides methods to interact with a MongoDB collection.

**Example**

**Setup Instructions**

Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. MongoDB server
3. pymongo library

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
	```git clone git@github.com:Joseph-Les/CRUDInPython.git```
2. Install the required Python packages:
	```pip install pymongo```
3. Ensure your MongoDB server is running.


**Usage - Initialization**

The AnimalShelter class is used to interact with the MongoDB collection. You need to initialize it with your MongoDB connection details.

	shelter = AnimalShelter(user='', password='', host='', port=, db='', collection='')

**Create Method**

The create method inserts a document into the collection.
	
	new_animal = {
    		"name": "Max",
    		"species": "Dog",
    		"breed": "Golden Retriever",
    		"age": 5,
    		"adopted": False
	}
	insert_success = shelter.create(new_animal)
	print(f"Insert success: {insert_success}")

**Read Method**

The read method queries for documents in the collection based on a given query.

	query = {"species": "Dog"}
	dogs = shelter.read(query)
	print(f"Found dogs: {dogs}")

**Testing**

Open a new Jupyter Notebook to Test the CRUD operations. Ensure the test and  animal_shelter files are in the same directly, then insert the test with your DB information. Run test.

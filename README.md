# Animal Shelter CRUD Operations

**Project Overview**

This repo provides a Python module for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database (update and Delete is work in progress). The module is designed to be reusable and can be imported into other Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks. It includes a class, AnimalShelter, that provides methods to interact with a MongoDB collection.

**Example**

**Setup Instructions**

Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. MongoDB server
3. `pymongo` library

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
	```git clone git@github.com:Joseph-Les/CRUDInPython.git```
2. Install the required Python packages:
	```pip install pymongo```
3. Ensure your MongoDB server is running.


**Usage - Initialization**

The AnimalShelter class is used to interact with the MongoDB collection. You need to initialize it with your MongoDB connection details.

	shelter = AnimalShelter(user='', password='', host='', port=, db='', collection='')

**Create Method**

The create method inserts a document into the collection.
	
	new_animal = {
    		"name": "Max",
    		"species": "Dog",
    		"breed": "Golden Retriever",
    		"age": 5,
    		"adopted": False
	}
	insert_success = shelter.create(new_animal)
	print(f"Insert success: {insert_success}")

**Read Method**

The read method queries for documents in the collection based on a given query.

	query = {"species": "Dog"}
	dogs = shelter.read(query)
	print(f"Found dogs: {dogs}")

**Testing**

To ensure the functionality of the module, follow these steps to test it using a Jupyter Notebook.

1. Ensure your MongoDB server is running. Gather your database name and the user credentials..
   
	1A. Create a new user (optional):

    	db.createUser ({ user: "<name of the user>", pwd: "<password>", roles [( role: "readWrite", db: "<name of database>" }] })
   
2. Start a new Jupyter Notebook.
3. Insert the test script into the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook. Replace user, password, host, port, db, and collection with your own user information.
4. Edit the Create and Read methods to match your collection if using a different database structure.
5. Create a Python script within the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook, named animal_shelter.py, containing the AnimalShelter class definition.
6. Execute the code in the Jupyter Notebook to test the Create and Read functionalities.

By following these instructions, you should be able to reproduce and test the functionality of the Animal Shelter CRUD operations module.
